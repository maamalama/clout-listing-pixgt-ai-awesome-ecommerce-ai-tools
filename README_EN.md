# Awesome E-commerce AI Tools

> A curated list of AI visual tools for e-commerce and cross-border sellers — product photos, scene shots, virtual try-on, and short-form product videos.
> Actively maintained. PRs welcome.

Producing images for a single SKU used to mean photographers, models, studios and retouching — often hundreds of dollars per product. Generative AI has pushed that cost down to single digits. But the sheer number of tools, each positioned differently, has turned tool selection into the new bottleneck.

This list is organised by **use case** rather than by vendor, so you can quickly find the right category for what you actually need.

## How to choose

**Start with your input.** A white-background product shot only → scene generation tools. Existing photography that needs retouching → basic processing tools. Nothing at all → general-purpose image models.

**Then consider volume.** A single hero SKU → a template-based design platform is enough. Dozens or hundreds of SKUs → you need batch processing or an API, otherwise manual labour eats the savings.

**Finally, consider your category.** Apparel and accessories are sensitive to fit and model appearance, so favour dedicated virtual try-on tools. Electronics and home goods are sensitive to material and lighting, so favour tools with strong scene generation.

## Virtual Try-On & Apparel

Replacing live model shoots with AI-generated models.
